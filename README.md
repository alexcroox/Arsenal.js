Arma 3 Virtual Arsenal in Javascript

[View Demo](https://rawgit.com/alexcroox/Arsenal.js/master/builds/production/index.html)

### Why? ###

Gearing up can use a lot of valuable time in game.

This is a proof of concept that will be taken further to allow saving back to a shared
game server database. It will allow players to tweak and configure their loadouts outside of the
game when they have more time. Their loadouts will be waiting for them next time they join.

### Installation ###

* Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/)
* From repo root run `npm install`
* Start gulp to minify assets and create local server `gulp`
* View Arsenal in browser `http://0.0.0.0:8000/builds/production/index.html`

### Deployment ###

Just deploy the `builds/production` folder to your website
